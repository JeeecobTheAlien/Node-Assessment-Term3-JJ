1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment?
    It took 7 hours to complete the assignment.

2. What online resources you have used?
    I rewatched all Annies recorded classes and a few of your most recent classes Peter, If they were actually used and helpful in the assignment idk.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems.
    I didn't ask anyone for help to solve anything prefer not to ask unless I truly am lost regarding it.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors?
    I asked one question to Peter during the Fullstack Support Jan/25/2024 regarding the Node_modules.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
    I rate it a 7/10 (1 being Easy, 10 being Hard) for the only purpose the code itself was a 3.5 and the actual problems given was a 3.5 thats what takes most of my time as I need to read it several times as I have trouble reading!
